 * all secondary states that are (partially) defined by that primary state
 * change to.
 * 
 * Primary states are stored as a PrimaryState object, secondary states are
 * either stored as a CalculatedState object (state from an anonymous class) or
 * as a dedicated (predefined) secondary state object, see agent.state.secondary
